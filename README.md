# Welcome to my Coding Journey

This GitHub Repo is filled with projects I have worked on to teach myself coding.
My target is to work as a front-end engineer is the Web3 space, and slowly upskill myself into a full-stack engineer.

I've dabbled in the following: <br>
-HTML <br>
-CSS <br>
-Vanilla Javascript <br>
-React <br>
-Clarity Smart Contract Programming Language (Stacks Blockchain)
